# Module-5-Work-Day-Scheduler
<h1>Scheduler created by topics seen during Moldule 5</h1>

<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>For this challenge, a partial code was provided and we had to fill it in using knowledge obtained by the topics seen during module 5, which was 3rd Party APIs, such as jQuery and Bootstrap.</p> 
  
<p>This challenge consists of creating a scheduler for working hours only and it displays the date on the top. During the day, the sections are colored grey, red and green which represents past, present and future respectfully. This assists the user by identifying what the time visually. This web application also allows the user to type the tasks to be completed during the day and this is sent to local storage and is retreived when the web page is refreshed or opened after being closed.</p>
 
<h2><strong>Programming Logic</strong></h2>
<p>An API called DayJS was used to retrieve information of what currently day and time it is. This date is then shown on top of the page while the time is also transfomred in 24 hour format, this with the intention of being compared against the ID tag "hour-#" in section to then switch the class appropiately to present, past or future.</p>
  
<p>Due to the use of the function ready(), the code executes after the page loads so using event listeners became difficult.  .</p>
